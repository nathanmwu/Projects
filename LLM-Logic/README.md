# LLM-Logic

## Overview
This project explores logical reasoning and inference capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a series of structured tasks. Each task focuses on different aspects of logical reasoning and problem-solving.

## Project Structure
- `task2/`: Translation of natural language into Prolog knowledge base
- `task3/`: Testing functionality of pyswip library for multilayered inference
- `task4/`: Implementation of the Logic-LM algorithm, which leverages the robustness of a symbolic solver and the ability of LLMs to translate natural language into logic to interpret high-level logical problem inputs
- `task5/`: Summary and basic tutorial of Deontic Logic
- `task6/`: Implementation of backward chaining algorithm

## Getting Started
Each task directory contains its own set of problems and solutions. Navigate to individual task directories to see specific implementations and examples. Some tasks require the use of an API key for OpenAI.
