# Image Classification with ConvNeXt

## Overview
This project implements an image classification system using transfer learning with the ConvNeXt large model. ConvNeXt is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture that achieves excellent performance on various computer vision tasks.

## Project Structure
- `classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and training code
- `model_weights.pth`: Saved model weights after training

## Technical Details
- Model: ConvNeXt Large
- Framework: PyTorch
- Approach: Transfer Learning using pre-trained weights

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Jupyter Notebook
- CUDA (recommended for GPU acceleration)

## Getting Started
1. Install the required dependencies
2. Open `classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Follow the notebook cells for data preparation, model setup, and training
